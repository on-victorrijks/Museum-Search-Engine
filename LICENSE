This tool does not have a definitive name, it is called : “AI Museum Search Engine” for now.
 
This repository contains a web application allowing users (staff from the museum or the general public) to search a database of artworks, artists and subject matters (iconographies). The tool uses AI to sort the results, augment collections, sort collections and refine the results. Other additional algorithms are used to refine the results or to sort the collections.
 
This tool has been made to help the museums (more specifically the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium). It is not intended to be sold to them as a full product or as a subscription-based product. I wish that this tool remains free and accessible to museums.
